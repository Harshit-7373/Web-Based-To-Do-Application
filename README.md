This project is a real-time, web-based collaborative task management application inspired by platforms like Trello. It allows multiple users to register, log in, and collaboratively manage tasks across a live Kanban board with instant updates, smart task logic, and custom UI/UX. The application is built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) with Socket.IO for real-time communication.
